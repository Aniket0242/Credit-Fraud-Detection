# Credit-Fraud-Detection
In this project, the effectiveness of various predictive models in distinguishing between normal and fraudulent transactions will be evaluated. Although the dataset includes scaled features and omits feature names for privacy reasons, key aspects of the data can still be examined.

## Objective:
Analyze the distribution of the provided "little" data.
Create a balanced sub-data frame with a 50/50 ratio of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions using the NearMiss Algorithm.
Select and evaluate classifiers to determine which one has the highest accuracy.
Develop a Neural Network and compare its accuracy to that of the best-performing classifier.
