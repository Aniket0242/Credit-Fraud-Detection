# Credit-Fraud-Detection
In this repo, we will evaluate the effectiveness of different predictive models in distinguishing between normal and fraudulent transactions. While the dataset includes scaled features and omits feature names for privacy reasons, we can still examine key aspects of the data.

## Objective:
Analyze the distribution of the provided "little" data.
Create a balanced sub-data frame with a 50/50 ratio of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions using the NearMiss Algorithm.
Select and evaluate classifiers to determine which one has the highest accuracy.
Develop a Neural Network and compare its accuracy to the best-performing classifier.
